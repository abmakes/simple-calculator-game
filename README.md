# simple-calculator-game

This game was developed to practice the fundamentals skills in Python. I used the TKinter GUI as the user interface. 

### How it works:

- The game that shows your four random numbers and four operators (x, /, +  and -). 
- It also has an are where a eqaution is being displayed ( x ? y = ANSWER).
- You have to guess which numbers and operator was used to getto the answer.
- There is a score that counts how many you get right, as well as a countdown timer that stops the game after 100s.

Possible Future additions:
- Start menu
- High scores page
- Completion screen
- Re-write to Object-Oriented-Programming
